How could I care for him and love him when he is already half of this wonderful thing I had dreamed of us to be? How could I, when I know the other half isn't me and will never be.
It felt like it was our last tea together. I know it was our last tea together. And when he said "Bye," I knew very well that it was time to go too.
There was something in his smile. It was heavy, almost sad.
Before he could say anything, "Steve, this has got to stop. Your wedding is in four days. I can't have this right now, not anymore."
"Exactly, my wedding is in four days and I can't stop thinking that I am going to make this big mistake."
"You've dreamed for that day to come. She loves you and you adore her. And you two are going to be the envy of the stars, remember?"
"After what happened last night, I knew seeing this through is going to be the biggest mistake that I'll ever do, and I can't make that mistake. I won't. I won't make us miserable for the ..."
"What happened last night, that was the mistake Steve. What happened ..." I froze, I just froze, literally.
"I will never hurt you." He whispered. His left hand was still holding mine. Both rested on the headboard.
I was myself again.
He was looking intently at me, as if he saw what just flashed before me. It was as though he heard himself whisper those words.
These days, tears are the only thing that make me believe that I am still human.
I am hoping that one day, one random smile will make me believe that I am a human being, worthy.
I am going to move on this year. It's not going to be easy. I don't know how long it will take but I'll get there. I promise. You see, I have been holding on to a love that has been lost for a long time now. I have been holding on to something you never held on to and to something you'll never. I have let myself believe that you and I can be the envy of the stars. I have allowed myself to believe in a lie, the lie that is you.
So this year, I am going to cut the anchor that has been holding me down. I am cutting loose the anchor that is you.
Don't get me wrong. I don't hate you. I have loved every single moment that I have spent with you. I have loved every single memory I have of you. I have loved every single time I have spent thinking of you. I love you.
But I love myself too. I just have to learn to love myself more.
